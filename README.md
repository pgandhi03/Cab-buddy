# Cab-buddy
In universities we see that students and faculty members go to same place from the university, some on daily basis and some on weekly basis in different cabs or personal vehicles. So we are finding best way to make them meet other people who are going to same or nearby places at same time which will be beneficial to them financially and also will be good for the environment.
